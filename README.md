# jb = JailBreak
I have some old iPhones and am working on jailbreaking them and turning them into nodes on my in-home kubernetes cluster which currently consists of an old dell tower running Debian and a Raspberry Pi 3B+ on Raspbian. These iPhones be on some BSD Darwin shit tho. And now I need to learn some tings about Cydia, Theos, Objective-C, and probably other random shit just to get a compile installed on these bitches to build docekr and k8s from source (if it were only that simple XD)

In this repos I will chronicle my journey. Hopefully I can get it working if not learn something along the way. Without further ado.
